Change Surrounding Pairs
========================
csXY where X is the existing pair and Y is the desired pair.

"Hello world" -> cs"' -> 'Hello world'

Additionaly, in the case of opening and closing pairs (e.g., parens) using the
opening character causes leading and trailing whitespace between the pairs.
Using the closing character removes leading and trailing whitespace.

$hash{'key'} -> cs{{ -> $hash{ 'key' }

dsX deletes the pair

"Hello world" -> ds" -> Hello world

ysMOTIONX

Long sentence and wrap three words. -> ys3w" -> Long "sentence and wrap" three words.
